<h3 align="left">Features of Thomas Was Late:</h3>   
•A clock that counts down from a time appropriate to the challenge of
the level.
•Fire pits that emit a roar relative to the position of the player and respawn the player at the start if they fall in. Water pits have the same effect but
without the directional sound effects.</br>
•Cooperative gameplay. Both players will have to get their characters to the goal within the allotted time. They will need to work together frequently
so that the shorter, lower-jumping Bob will need to stand on his friend's (Thomas') head.</br>
•The player will have the option of switching between full and split-screen so they can attempt to control both characters themselves.</br>
•Each level will be designed in, and loaded from, a text file. This will make it easy to design varied and numerous levels.</br>
